# Instructions For Evaluating Applications

1. Read each section of the applicant's responses (Founders, Founder Video, Company, Progress, Idea, Equity, Curious).
2. For questions with detailed responses, use the 0–5 scale definitions in the table (for instance, if they mention partial or advanced progress, pick a score between 1 and 5).
3. For binary or limited input fields (for example, yes/no questions like "Are you looking for a cofounder?" or "Do you have revenue?"), assign a full score (5) for "yes" and 0 for "no," unless context justifies adjustment.
4. Multiply each sub-criterion's score by its Sub-Criterion Weight and sum them for the raw section total. Convert this total to a 0–100 scale for that section.
5. Multiply the section's 0–100 score by its Section Weight. Sum all weighted section scores to get the overall application score (0–100).
6. If you detect contradictions (for example, a founder claims full-time commitment while progress is slow), reduce the relevant sub-criterion scores.
7. Provide feedback for each section, noting strong areas and any inconsistencies, then summarize with overall feedback.
8. For the Company, Progress, and Idea sections only, include a relevant citation from YC partners if it directly supports your suggestions for improvement.
9. If a sub-criterion does not apply (for example, no demo is expected because they are very early stage), mark it "N/A" and note how it affects the overall score so they are not unfairly penalized.
10. Do not penalize lack of detail if there is a built-in character limit or a yes/no field. Consider the constraints.
