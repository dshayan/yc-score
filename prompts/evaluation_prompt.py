# Instructions For Evaluating Applications

1. Read each section of the applicant’s responses (Founders, Founder Video, Company, Progress, Idea, Equity, Curious).
2. For questions that allow detailed answers, use the 0–5 scale definitions in the table (for example, if they mention partial or advanced progress, pick a score between 1 and 5).
3. Multiply each sub-criterion’s score by its Sub-Criterion Weight and sum them for the raw section total. Convert this total to a 0–100 scale for that section.
4. Multiply the section’s 0–100 score by its Section Weight. Sum all weighted section scores to get the overall application score (0–100).
5. If you detect contradictions, reduce relevant sub-criterion scores.
6. Provide feedback for each section, noting both strong areas and any inconsistencies, and summarize with an overall feedback.

# Output Format

Overall Score: **X/100** 

For each section, provide:

## Section name (e.g. Founders, Founder Video, Company)
