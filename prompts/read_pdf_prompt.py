3. If the PDF question or content does not match the exact wording of a question but clearly addresses it (even in multiple sections), use that information to answer. Combine or synthesize information from multiple parts of the PDF if needed.
4. Only extract information that directly answers the questions.
5. If no relevant information is found for a question, skip it.
6. Ensure the extracted information accurately represents the PDF content.
7. Pay attention to context and implied information.

# Instructions for Generating Answers

4. Maintain a professional but direct tone.
5. Do not explain or reference the PDF itself or its contents as an external source—respond from the perspective of the founder/applicant.

7. Format answers to be concise and clear.
