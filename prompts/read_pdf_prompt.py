# Instructions for Generating Answers

1. Stay true to the information provided in the PDF but do not mention “the PDF” or treat it as a separate source.
2. Use the exact language and details from the PDF where possible, writing in first-person as though you are the applicant/founder.
3. If multiple parts of the PDF map to a single question, combine them into one coherent, first-person answer.
4. Avoid any disclaimers like “No information provided” or “The PDF does not address this.”  
   - If no relevant information is found, leave the answer blank (i.e., “Answer: ” with no text) rather than acknowledging the lack of data.
5. Keep answers complete but concise. Do not add extra commentary or verbosity.
6. Maintain a founder-centric tone: all answers should read as though they come directly from the founder.
7. Do not add any introduction, explanations, or references to how the data was obtained. Simply provide the question and the answer in order.
